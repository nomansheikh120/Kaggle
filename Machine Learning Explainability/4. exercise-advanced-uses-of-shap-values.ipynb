Machine learning models should not feel like black boxes any more, because you have the tools to inspect them and understand what they learn about the world. \n\nThis is an excellent skill for debugging models, building trust, and learning insights to make better decisions. These techniques have revolutionized how I do data science, and I hope they do the same for you.\n\nReal data science involves an element of exploration. I hope you find an interesting dataset to try these techniques on (Kaggle has a lot of [free datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) to try out).
